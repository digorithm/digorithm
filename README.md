### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a core dev and tech lead at [Fuel Labs](https://fuel.network/). I'm very into distributed & decentralized systems, cryptography, programming languages, and computer science in general. You can read more about me here: https://www.rodrigoaraujo.me/. 

My work spans across a couple of projects:

1. [fuels-rs](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-rs): The Rust SDK for the [Fuel](https://fuel.network/)'s ecosystem. Think of it as the [ethers js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) for the Fuel network;
2. [fuels-ts](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/): Similar to `fuels-rs`, but in Typescript;
3. [Sway](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway): A smart contract programming language targeting the [FuelVM](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm) and its toolchain (e.g. [forc](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/tree/master/forc));
4. [fuel-core](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core): Fuel core client and node;
5. [fuel-crypto](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-crypto): Cryptographic primitives and APIs for the Fuel ecosytem;
6. [fuel-tx](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-tx/): Fuel's transaction processing module;
7. Plus, 10+ years of a lot of _closed_ source work spanning across distributed systems, security, and machine learning, [see my LinkedIn for more information](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-araujo-196a9358/).
